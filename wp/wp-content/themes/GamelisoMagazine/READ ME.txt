HOW TO CHANGE THE LOGO
======================
In themes folder, look up for the LOGO folder. Inside is a logo.rar archive, unpack it with winrar. Open logo.psd in photoshop and rename it, turn off background layer, then - File/Save for web, choose png24 format (transparency must be checked), and save/replace it (replace it) with logo in themename/images folder. Voila!
Install font (if provided) from logo.rar to your computer if you dont have it. 


THEME OPTIONS
============
To make slider working, you should select sliding category via theme options and number of slides.
If you want to have small thumbnails in mygallery plugin, you have to type thumbnail (lowercase) in custom field and leave link to the image.


POST THUMBNAILS - how to add images into posts
==============================================
This theme supports post thumbnails, and we encourage you to use this option for theme to work as imagined! 

How to insert image as a post thumbnail? 

For example, click on add new post. 
On the bottom right side under "Post tags" you'll see a "Set featured image" option, and click on it.
Upload the image, click "Use as featured image" and thats it!
You dont have to touch anything other (alignment, sizes, nothing), theme will do the rest!


You also can adjust image size according to your wishes. Just open up index.php, find 'image_class' => 'alignleft', 'width' => '200', 'height' => '150'")
and change 200, 150 (this values may be different for every our theme) to whatever you like. If you want images to be aligned right or centered, just change alignleft to alignright or aligncenter and save. 

Classic way of inserting images is still working with this theme, but featured categories (latest articles on categories) option - IS NOT if theme has it! It's set to pull post thumbnails images where images are inserted as thumbnails, classic inserted images will not show, insted - default image will show (can be found in theme-folder/images/fcdefault.jpg).
